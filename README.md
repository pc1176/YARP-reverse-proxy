**YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) Documentation**

---

### Overview
YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) is a highly customizable reverse proxy built on ASP.NET Core. It enables forwarding HTTP requests to different backends, load balancing, routing, and handling authentication, among other functionalities. YARP leverages ASP.NETâ€™s middleware pipeline, making it a versatile solution for microservices and modern web architectures.

---

### Key Features
1. **Dynamic Configuration**: Configure routes and clusters dynamically via JSON or runtime APIs.
2. **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across backend services using algorithms such as round-robin, least requests, etc.
3. **Routing**: Route incoming HTTP requests to specific backends based on path, header, query string, or other criteria.
4. **Protocol Support**: Supports HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 protocols.
5. **Middleware Integration**: Use ASP.NET Core middleware for authentication, logging, and request/response transformations.
6. **Health Probing**: Perform active and passive health checks to ensure service availability.

### Diagram

Below is a diagram illustrating the YARP architecture:

1. **Client** sends an HTTP request to YARP.
2. **YARP Reverse Proxy** evaluates the request against configured routes.
3. Based on routing rules, YARP forwards the request to a backend destination.
4. **Backend Services** process the request and return the response to YARP.
5. **YARP Reverse Proxy** sends the response back to the client.

### Installation
Add the YARP NuGet package to your ASP.NET Core project:

```
 dotnet add package Microsoft.ReverseProxy
```

---

### Configuration
YARP can be configured in the `appsettings.json` file or programmatically during runtime.

#### Example Configuration in `appsettings.json`

```json
{
  "ReverseProxy": {
    "Routes": {
      "route1": {
        "ClusterId": "cluster1",
        "Match": {
          "Path": "/api/{**catch-all}"
        }
      }
    },
    "Clusters": {
      "cluster1": {
        "Destinations": {
          "destination1": {
            "Address": "https://backend-service1.example.com/"
          },
          "destination2": {
            "Address": "https://backend-service2.example.com/"
          }
        },
        "LoadBalancingPolicy": "RoundRobin"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Programmatic Configuration in `Startup.cs`

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddReverseProxy()
    .LoadFromConfig(builder.Configuration.GetSection("ReverseProxy"));

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapReverseProxy();

app.Run();
```

---

### Advanced Features
#### Middleware Integration
Customize request/response handling by integrating custom middleware:

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    // Modify the request
    context.Request.Headers.Add("X-Proxy-Header", "YARP");
    await next.Invoke();
    // Modify the response
    context.Response.Headers.Add("X-Processed-By", "YARP");
});
```

#### Dynamic Route Updates
Update routes or clusters dynamically:

```csharp
var proxyConfigProvider = app.Services.GetRequiredService<IProxyConfigProvider>();
// Custom implementation to update routes/clusters at runtime.
```

---

### Health Probing
Enable health checks for backends to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy destinations.

#### Example Health Probing Configuration

```json
{
  "Clusters": {
    "cluster1": {
      "HealthCheck": {
        "Active": {
          "Enabled": true,
          "Interval": "00:00:10",
          "Timeout": "00:00:05",
          "Policy": "Simple",
          "Path": "/health"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Use Cases
1. **Microservices Gateway**: Simplify service discovery and routing in microservices-based applications.
2. **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic evenly across multiple service instances.
3. **API Gateway**: Act as a secure entry point for APIs with support for authentication and authorization.
4. **Service Migrations**: Route traffic to newer service versions without disrupting clients.
